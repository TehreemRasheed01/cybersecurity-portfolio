# Memory Forensics

Memory forensics is a crucial subfield in digital forensics, which involves acquisition and analysis of a computer's volatile memory or, in other words, the computer's RAM. The information stored in a computer's RAM can provide valuable insights into the state the system at the time of acquisition. The acquired memory is normally referred to as a memory dump, and can be particularly useful in identifying running processes, user credentials, network connections, registry keys, encryption keys, browser history, clipboard contents, and other valuable information.

In this lab, we'll explore the fundamentals of memory forensics, including techniques, and tools for collecting and analyzing memory dumps to support incident response, malware analysis, and other forensic investigations.

## Acquiring Memory Dumps

Acquiring evidence is always the initial step in any digital forensics investigation, and in memory forensics, this means acquiring a computer's volatile memory. There are several tools we can use for acquiring memory dumps on live machines, however, the most common ones include:

- DumpIt â€” a light-weight command-line utility for Windows.
- FTK Imager â€” a popular image forensics tool.
- Redline â€” a memory analysis tool developed by FireEye.


> ðŸ’¡ To acquire a memory image from offline Windows machines, we can extract it from `%SystemDrive%/hiberfil.sys`, which contains a compressed memory image from the previous boot that is normally kept to provide faster boot-up times.

In this lab, we'll be using DumpIt to collect a memory dump file for analysis, which can be downloaded from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thimbleweed/All-In-USB/master/utilities/DumpIt/DumpIt.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thimbleweed/All-In-USB/master/utilities/DumpIt/DumpIt.exe).

> Note: Acquiring a memory dump can be a time-consuming process, so you may use the memory dump that is available for download at the link provided in the next section. 

When you have downloaded the tool, go ahead and double-click on the executable file. This will launch a command prompt that will ask you to confirm the memory capture by typing 'y' or 'n'. Type 'y' to confirm, and the tool will immediately initiate the memory capture process:

```

	  --> Are you sure you want to continue? [y/n]
		+ Processing...
```

As a result, the memory dump file will be saved in the same directory where the tool was launched.

> ðŸ’¡ The memory dump file extension can vary depending on the tool used to create the dump. Some common extensions for memory dumps include `.raw`, `.mem`, `.vmem`, and `.bin`.

## Analyzing Memory Dumps

Analyzing memory dumps can provide valuable information about the state of a system at the time of memory dump acquisition, such as running processes, network connections, user credentials, browser history, encryption keys, any anything else that might have been present in the memory at the time of its acquisition, including any artifacts that may have been left by malware. This is especially useful in case of file-less malware that tend to reside inside the memory.

Enter [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility), the tool we'll be using to analyze memory dumps. It is a must-have memory forensics tool in your digital forensics toolkit, is open-source, written in Python, is a popular choice for analyzing memory dumps and widely used by forensic investigators.

> Note: Before we proceed with the installation, make sure that you have Python 2 installed on your system.

To install Volatility, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility.git && cd volatility
sudo python2 setup.py install
sudo pip2 install pycryptodome
```

These commands will clone the Volatility repository from GitHub, and install the tool and its dependencies. 

To verify that Volatility is installed correctly, you can run the command `python2 vol.py` in the terminal, which should produce output similar to the following:

```
$ python2 vol.py 
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
*** Failed to import volatility.plugins.malware.apihooks (NameError: name 'distorm3' is not defined)
*** Failed to import volatility.plugins.malware.threads (NameError: name 'distorm3' is not defined)
*** Failed to import volatility.plugins.mac.apihooks_kernel (ImportError: No module named distorm3)
*** Failed to import volatility.plugins.mac.check_syscall_shadow (ImportError: No module named distorm3)
*** Failed to import volatility.plugins.ssdt (NameError: name 'distorm3' is not defined)
*** Failed to import volatility.plugins.mac.apihooks (ImportError: No module named distorm3)
ERROR   : volatility.debug    : You must specify something to do (try -h)
```

The import errors above indicate that the `distorm3` package is missing, but you can ignore them as we don't need that package for this lab. However, if you want to fix the errors, you can manually install the `distorm3` package.

Now that we have installed volatility, the next step should be to get a memory dump to analyze. You can either use DumpIt or FTK Imager to collect one, or if you prefer, you can download the dump I've already acquired from [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gwe4jbv5qXO5WXQ-2p4N24HP6thC7l4Z/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gwe4jbv5qXO5WXQ-2p4N24HP6thC7l4Z/view?usp=sharing).

To provide our memory dump file as input to Volatility, we can use the `-f` option (remember to provide the full path to the dump file if it's not in the current directory):

```
$ python2 vol.py -f /path/to/smaple.mem
```

To begin our analysis, the first step is to identify the profile of the system that the dump was taken from. This can be done using the `imageinfo` plugin in Volatility, which will display information about the system's architecture, operating system version, and service pack level, among other details:

```
$ python2 vol.py -f sample.mem imageinfo
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
INFO    : volatility.debug    : Determining profile based on KDBG search...
          Suggested Profile(s) : Win7SP1x64, Win7SP0x64, Win2008R2SP0x64, Win2008R2SP1x64_24000, Win2008R2SP1x64_23418, Win2008R2SP1x64, Win7SP1x64_24000, Win7SP1x64_23418

     Image local date and time : 2023-04-02 20:04:02 +0500
```

Based on the output above, we can see that there are multiple suggested profiles. The first one is usually the correct one to use, which in this case is `Win7SP1x64`. We'll be specifying this profile in our next commands.

> ðŸ’¡ We specify the profile in Volatility to help the tool determine the proper memory layout, the operating system and service pack version on the system where the memory was captured from. This information is necessary for the tool to properly analyze the memory dump.

### Listing Running Processes

One important aspect of memory forensics is to determine what processes were running at the time when the memory dump was acquired. We can use the `pslist` plugin for this purpose:

```
$ python2 vol.py -f sample.mem --profile Win7SP1x64 pslist

<SNIPPED>
```

The output includes the offset where the process is residing within the memory, the process ID (PID), process name, and other details such as the parent process ID (PPID), number of threads, number of handles, as well as the start and exit time.

Similarly, we can use the `pstree` plugin to display the process tree of the running processes. This can be useful in identifying the parent process of a specific process, which can help to detect malicious processes attempting to hide their presence by masquerading as legitimate processes:

```
$ python2 vol.py -f sample.mem --profile Win7SP1x64 pstree

### Listing Network Connections

To list the active network connections at the time of memory dump acquisition, we can use the `netscan` plugin:

```
$ python2 vol.py -f sample.mem --profile Win7SP1x64 netscan
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1

<SNIPPED>
```

The output above displays information about the connections, including the protocol, local and foreign addresses and ports, current state, PID, owner, and the creation time. This is similar to what you would get when running `netstat` on Linux.

### Listing Environment Variables

If we want to see a list of environment variables at the time when the memory dump was acquired, we can use the `envars` plugin. This can be helpful in identifying any environment variables that may have been set by malware:

```
$ python2 vol.py -f sample.mem --profile Win7SP1x64 envars

## Conclusion

To conclude, memory forensics is a powerful technique in the field of digital forensics. By analyzing a memory dump, we can extract valuable information such as running processes, network connections, environment variables, and much more, which can help in identifying the root cause of an incident and help us maintain a proactive approach against potential security incidents in future.

Finally, while we have only covered the basics, there are lots of other methodologies left undiscussed in this lab, which I urge you to explore on your own. I highly recommend checking out the book [The Art of Memory Forensics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Memory-Forensics-Detecting-Malware/dp/1118825098) as a starting point. Additionally, if you need to practice your memory forensics skills, you can check out [MemLabs](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs), a collection of educational, CTF-styled labs.

# Exercises

You work as a senior digital forensic investigator for an intelligence agency that specializes in investigating cybercriminals. Recently, they made a major breakthrough in a case against a notorious ransomware gang and were able to apprehend several members of the gang, including their leader. In the course of the arrest, the team acquired memory dumps of each of the gang members' computer.

It is suspected that the leader was using Windows 7 at the time, and had been hiding some secret information related to the gang's operations on his computer. Being a senior member of the team, the intelligence agency has trusted you with the memory dump of the leader's computer and has tasked you with finding the secret information which could potentially be hidden in the following places:

- It may have been copied to the clipboard.
- It may have been searched for on the internet.
- It may have been saved in an environment variable.
- It may have been executed as a command.
- It may have been drawn using MSPaint.

The secret information you are looking for is in the form of a flag with the format `flag{xxxx}`, where `xxxx` represents a set of alphanumeric characters that make up the flag. There are a total of 5 flags that you need to find. Good luck!
